## Essential Formulas

### Basic Volatility Calculations

**Close-to-Close Volatility**:
```
σ = √(252 × (1/n) × Σ(r_t - r̄)²)

where:
r_t = ln(P_t / P_{t-1})
r̄ = average return
n = number of observations
```

**Parkinson Estimator**:
```
σ²_Parkinson = (1/4×ln(2)) × (1/n) × Σ[ln(H_t/L_t)]²

where:
H_t = high price on day t
L_t = low price on day t
```

**Yang-Zhang Estimator**:
```
σ²_YZ = σ²_overnight + k×σ²_open-to-close + (1-k)×σ²_Rogers-Satchell

where:
k = 0.34 / (1 + (n+1)/(n-1))
```

### Option Pricing Models

**Black-Scholes Formula**:
```
C = S₀N(d₁) - Ke^(-rT)N(d₂)
P = Ke^(-rT)N(-d₂) - S₀N(-d₁)

where:
d₁ = [ln(S₀/K) + (r + σ²/2)T] / (σ√T)
d₂ = d₁ - σ√T

C = call price, P = put price
S₀ = current stock price, K = strike price
r = risk-free rate, T = time to expiration
σ = volatility, N(x) = cumulative normal distribution
```

### Greeks Formulas

**Delta**:
```
Δ_call = N(d₁)
Δ_put = N(d₁) - 1 = -N(-d₁)
```

**Gamma**:
```
Γ = φ(d₁) / (S₀σ√T)

where φ(x) = standard normal density function
```

**Theta**:
```
Θ_call = -[S₀φ(d₁)σ/(2√T)] - rKe^(-rT)N(d₂)
Θ_put = -[S₀φ(d₁)σ/(2√T)] + rKe^(-rT)N(-d₂)
```

**Vega**:
```
ν = S₀φ(d₁)√T
```

**Vanna**:
```
Vanna = -φ(d₁) × d₂/σ
```

**Volga**:
```
Volga = S₀φ(d₁)√T × (d₁d₂/σ)
```

### VIX Calculation

**VIX Formula**:
```
VIX² = (2/T) × Σ[(ΔK_i/K_i²) × Q(K_i)] - (1/T) × [(F/K₀) - 1]²

where:
T = time to expiration
ΔK_i = interval between strikes
K_i = strike price
Q(K_i) = option quote (call or put)
F = forward level
K₀ = at-the-money strike
```

### Risk Metrics

**Value at Risk (VaR)**:
```
VaR = -[μ + σ × Φ⁻¹(α)]

where:
μ = expected return
σ = volatility
Φ⁻¹(α) = inverse normal distribution at confidence level α
```

**Expected Shortfall**:
```
ES = -E[X | X ≤ VaR] = -(1/α) ∫₀^α VaR(β) dβ
```

### Correlation and Dispersion

**Dispersion Formula**:
```
σ²_Index = Σ(w²ᵢ × σ²ᵢ) + Σ Σ(wᵢwⱼρᵢⱼσᵢσⱼ)

where:
wᵢ = weight of stock i
σᵢ = volatility of stock i  
ρᵢⱼ = correlation between stocks i and j
```

**Portfolio Volatility**:
```
σ_portfolio = √(w'Σw)

where:
w = weight vector
Σ = covariance matrix
```
